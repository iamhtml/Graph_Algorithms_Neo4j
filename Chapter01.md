Today’s most pressing data challenges center around relationships, not just tabulating
discrete data. Graph technologies and analytics provide powerful tools for connected
data that are used in research, social initiatives, and business solutions such as:
- Modeling dynamic environments from financial markets to IT services
- Forecasting the spread of epidemics as well as rippling service delays and outages
- Finding predictive features for machine learning to combat financial crimes
- Uncovering patterns for personalized experiences and recommendations
As data becomes increasingly interconnected and systems increasingly sophisticated,
it’s essential to make use of the rich and evolving relationships within our data.
