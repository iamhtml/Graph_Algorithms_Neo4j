#介绍

Today’s most pressing data **challenges** center around relationships, not just **tabulating**
discrete data. Graph technologies and analytics provide powerful tools for connected
data that are used in research, social initiatives, and business solutions such as:
- Modeling dynamic environments from financial markets to IT services
- Forecasting the spread of **epidemics** as well as rippling service delays and outages
- Finding predictive features for machine learning to combat financial crimes
- Uncovering patterns for personalized experiences and recommendations
As data becomes increasingly interconnected and systems increasingly **sophisticated**,
it’s **essential** to make use of the rich and evolving relationships within our data.

今天，大多数紧急数据**挑战**中心在关系中，不单只是**列表显示**来描述数据。 图表技术和分析赋予了强大的工具和连接数据，这些能被用于研究、社会长椅、企业解决方案，如：
- 模拟动态的环境从金融市场到IT服务
- 预测**流行病**的蔓延和连锁反应服务的延迟和停电
- 找到预测的因素给机器学习来与金融危机做斗争
- 揭示个人体验（个性化体验）和推荐的模式
当数据变得增长和共连并且系统增长得那么**复杂**，它的**本质**是大而且能关系的关系在我们的数据中。


This chapter provides an introduction to graph analysis and graph algorithms. We’ll
start with a brief refresher about the origin of graphs before introducing graph algorithms
and explaining the difference between graph databases and graph processing.
We’ll explore the nature of modern data itself, and how the information contained in
connections is far more sophisticated than what we can uncover with basic statistical
methods. The chapter will conclude with a look at use cases where graph algorithms
can be employed.

本章介绍了图表分析和图表算法。在介绍图表算法之前，我们将开始一个简短的复习关于图表基础
