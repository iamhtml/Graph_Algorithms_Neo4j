# 前言

The world is driven by connections—from financial and communication systems to
social and biological processes. 
Revealing the meaning behind these connections
drives breakthroughs across industries in areas such as identifying fraud rings and
optimizing recommendations to evaluating the strength of a group and predicting
cascading failures.

世界是被“连接”所驱动的——从金融、沟通系统到社会、生物过程。
揭示其背后那些“连接” 带动行业领域的突破，比如识别诈骗团伙、优化识别来进化群组和预测的强度连级故障。

As connectedness continues to accelerate, it’s not surprising that interest in graph
algorithms has exploded because they are based on [mathematics explicitly] developed
to gain insights from the relationships between data. Graph analytics can uncover the
workings of [intricate] systems and networks at massive scales—for any organization.

当连接继续加速， 图表算法的发现其实并不意外，因为他们基于[确定的数学] 开发用于从数据的关系中获取洞见。图表分析能揭开 [错综复杂]的系统和网络在很大范围内给任何企业、组织、单位。

We are passionate about the [utility] and importance of graph analytics as well as the
joy of uncovering the inner workings of complex [scenarios]. Until recently, adopting
graph analytics required significant expertise and determination, because tools and
integrations were difficult and few knew how to apply graph algorithms to their
[quandaries]. It is our goal to help change this. We wrote this book to help organizations
better [leverage] graph analytics so that they can make new discoveries and
develop intelligent solutions faster.
