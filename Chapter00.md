# 前言

The world is driven by connections—from financial and communication systems to
social and biological processes. 
Revealing the meaning behind these connections
drives breakthroughs across industries in areas such as identifying fraud rings and
optimizing recommendations to evaluating the strength of a group and predicting
cascading failures.
世界是被“连接”所驱动的——从金融、沟通系统到社会、生物过程。
揭示其背后那些“连接” 带动行业领域的突破，比如识别诈骗团伙、优化识别来进化群组和预测的强度连级故障。

As connectedness continues to accelerate, it’s not surprising that interest in graph
algorithms has exploded because they are based on **mathematics explicitly** developed
to gain insights from the relationships between data. Graph analytics can uncover the
workings of **intricate** systems and networks at massive scales—for any organization.
当连接继续加速， 图表算法的发现其实并不意外，因为他们基于**确定的数学** 开发用于从数据的关系中获取洞见。图表分析能揭开 **错综复杂**的系统和网络在很大范围内给任何企业、组织、单位。

We are passionate about the **utility** and importance of graph analytics as well as the
joy of uncovering the inner workings of complex **scenarios**. Until recently, **adopting**
graph analytics required significant expertise and **determination**, because tools and
integrations were difficult and few knew how to apply graph algorithms to their
**quandaries**. It is our goal to help change this. We wrote this book to help organizations
better **leverage** graph analytics so that they can make new discoveries and
develop intelligent solutions faster.

我们对图表分析的效用和重要程度满怀热情，正如对揭开复杂清洁的享受一般。
直到最近，运用图表分析需要专业和决心，因为工具和决心都很难得并且很少有人能运用图表分析来解决自己的困惑。




## 1. 这本书里有什么？
This book is a practical guide to getting started with graph algorithms for developers
and data scientists who have experience using Apache Spark™ or Neo4j. Although our
algorithm examples **utilize** the Spark and Neo4j platforms, this book will also be helpful
for understanding more general graph **concepts**, regardless of your choice of
graph technologies.
这本书是一本实用指南，对象是已有Apache Spark™ or Neo4j使用经验的图表算法开发者和数据分析师，尽管我们的算法示例是运用在Spark and Neo4j平台的，但不管你用什么图表技术，这本书也会更加宏观的帮助理解图表概念。






我看这本书的目的是什么？
是有个大概的了解，然后能够应用它
翻译成中文是因为要确保自己明白了每一个单词，不自己试过、做过是不知道把事情做好有多不容易。
